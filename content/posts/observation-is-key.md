Recently, I have been thinking about what's the possibility if someone starts observing things closely. Be it business related or personal, I think you'd get a lot of things that you didn't know otherwise.

Start visualizing things. If you're into marketing, put yourself in the position of the customers and then start to visualize things -- how will they react, how will it affect them, etc. and you will know if it's going to be a good marketing campaign or not.

If you're observing a business competitor closely, you'd not just learn about their ideas and vision, but you will have multiple better and improved ideas for your business, of course it's derived from theirs but it's yours and original.

And yes, here I am making it feel like this "observation" that I am talking about is only limited to the business and marketing, but no, business is just a more relatable field to me. Do you want to guess who else shine into this "observation" thing? Writers, of course, are one of the most keen observers. Whether they have to develop a new character or build a story around the characters, they won't or better to say can't function at all.

Another example would be share market investors, they observe the massive flow of data and then draw a conclusion if they should invest in the stock. Cool, right?

So I am repeating the sentence again, here:

> Observation is the key.

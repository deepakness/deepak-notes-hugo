I used Notion for more than 2 years and now using Obsidian for more than 1 years, so I guess, I understand both the apps and their usecases.

For writing, freewriting or article writing, I would [never use Notion](https://deepakness.com/blog/notion-not-for-writers/) because it's very slow but for managing projects and personal life, there is no app better than Notion.

For all kinds of writing where collaboaration is not required, I prefer to use [Obsidian](https://compile.blog/tools/obsidian-md/) because it's fast, all the data stays locally, and is distraction free. Whenever I feel like taking a quick note on my computer, Obsidian is just 1-2 clicks away to start writing but in Notion, I have to navigate to the correct page and then start writing, plus it's slow as hell.

I am, now, using Obsidian for more than a year and have never been happier enough. And, if you ask, click the link here to see the main reasons [why I love Obsidian](https://deepakness.com/blog/obsidian-love/).

## Wrapping it up

I would prefer to use Obsidian for all my writing tasks but if I have to manage a big or small project, I would immediately move to Notion.

I think, if Notion enables the Offline feature, people will take the app even more seriously.

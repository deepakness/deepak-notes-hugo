## Why Developer Story?

- **Better Than CVs & Resumes**

The traditional resume format doesn’t fit a developer’s needs. You are more than a list of places you worked.

- **Based On What You've Built**

Highlight what matters most to you whether it's a project you coded, a blog post you wrote, or a position you've held.

- **Your Story, Your Way**

Developer Story is designed to give you greater control over how you present your work and pursue your career goals.

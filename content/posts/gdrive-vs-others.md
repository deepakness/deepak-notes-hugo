In the past, I have tried Google Drive, Dropbox, pCloud, Onedrive, Mega, etc. but I always keep coming back to Google Drive. As an Android user, I think, Google Drive somehow bounds you to keep using it. Plus, I like it too.

One of the main reasons of using Google Drive is that it's very well integrated with the current system of devices that I use. Currently, I am using an Android phone, a Chromebook laptop, and a Windows laptop; and on all these platforms, I can easily set up the Google Drive clients and keep my files synced.

Yes, pCloud and other platforms also have mobile as well as desktop apps for almost all operating systems but they are not as flawless as Google Drive on Android.

Also, Google Drive is a bit cheaper (except for [pCloud](https://compile.blog/pcloud-review/)) if you compare its monthly plan with the other platforms like Dropbox or Onedrive.

Another point is that sometimes I get worried about losing my files, I start thinking that what will happen if the company decides to shut down the platform, how will I prevent the files from deleting, etc. And, then I think that bigger companies have lesser chances of closing down than a smaller one, and then I keep using Google Drive for all my needs.

Yes, it might sound funny but I do not have any immediate plan to move to another platform anytime soon.

I was thinking about how intelligently the whole touchscreen and smartphone navigation technology has been put so far -- it's very interesting.

Earlier, there was only 1 variable -- the position/location of the touch. If you touched the icon, the app will open.

But now... there's a whole different story to this. Now, we have introduced other variables like the time of touch and the path of touch (swipe gestures). If you long-touched the icon, there will trigger different actions than just touching the icon. Also, the path of touch has completely different meaning too.

It's kind of fascinating and interesting to me!

What do you say?

I have seen YouTubers defending the platform by saying that Tiktok-like videos are trash and they have no future. YouTube videos provide better and more informative content -- true, but I still think that Tiktok-styled short videos are going to be the future.

Why?

Because the attention sapn in people is decreasing and every one prefers to watch a sweet and short video for entertainment. In fact, you can notice the trend from the last few decades -- earlier, the movies were 2.5-3 hours long and people actually sat down to watch it, but now? Now, movies are only 1.5 hours or max. to max. 2 hours long in almost every part of the world because of the decreased attention span.

Another example would be the Cricket game. Earlier there were 5-days test matches played and people would stick to their TVs to watch the whole match. Then there came a one-day format which lasted almost a day and then the T-20 format which only lasts a couple of hours. I am sure they will launch some new shorter format soon as per the public demand.

And, the same applies to the videos that I am talking about. We all grew up watching You

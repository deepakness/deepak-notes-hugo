Spreadsheets run the world!!! 🌍

And, Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel are the "big fishes" of the spreadsheet market. 🦈

However, companies like Notion and Airtable have much more to offer than just a simple spreadsheet. Every #Notion and #Airtable template is a SaaS Company. 🔥

Also, it seems that the all-new Spreadsheet.com is going to take this #spreadsheet game to a whole new level. 🤞

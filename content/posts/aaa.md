According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)),

> In the video-game industry, AAA (pronounced and sometimes written Triple-A) is an informal classification used to categorise games produced and distributed by a mid-sized or major publisher, which typically have higher development and marketing budgets than other tiers of games.

In the mid-2010s, the term "AAA+" was used to describe AAA type games that generated additional revenue over time, in a similar fashion to massively multiplayer online games, by using games-as-a-service methods such as season passes and expansion packs.

The similar construction "III" (Triple-I) has also been used to describe high-production-value games in the indie game industry.

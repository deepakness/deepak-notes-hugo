Recently, I discovered a new habit of mine: Listening to the long and mindset-teaching YouTube videos while watching. Yes, listening not watching. It's a lot fun.

I have YouTube Premium and that lets me play videos in the background, means you can turn off your phone's screen and then keep listening to the sound via earphone. Amazing, right?

I get a lot of ideas while walking. I keep my Microsoft Todo app open and as soon as I get something, I note it down.

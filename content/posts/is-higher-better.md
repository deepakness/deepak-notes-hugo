After reading the above statement, the immediate strike that comes into the mind is, "oh, sad, it has reduced further" but then I'd realize that it's better when the latency is lower.

Yes, it's not a big deal but my point is that am I biased towards "higher"? Why doesn't the first thought say that the lower can also be better, sometimes?

Am I alone, or do you feel the same way?

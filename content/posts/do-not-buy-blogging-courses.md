title: "Blogging courses are trash!"
---

Most of the blogging and digitalmarketing courses do not teach "how to create content".

These courses have plenty of tips-tricks and ideas but lack the most important topic - content creation.

I've seen people creating blogs and YouTube channels after watching online courses and then giving up because they have no idea about content creation.

In my opinion, if you create content (courses, articles, videos, etc.) about how to create content, you'll get noticed. And, people will actually be interested.

From researching and formatting to copywriting, many things can be covered.

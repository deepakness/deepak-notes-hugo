Today, you can learn almost anything for free. Almost all the information is available for free.

Then... the main question is: why do people pay for courses if they can get the same informaiton for free?

**Structured and Organized Learning.**

Yes, there is so much information on every topic that people don't understand which is good and which is bad. Also, people don't know how to be better at searching and finding resources that you can't find easily on Google.

So, if someone provides all the free resources in an organized and easy to understand manner - people pay for it.

That's it.

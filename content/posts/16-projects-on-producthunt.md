- ask someone popular to hunt you
    - they will make your product appear on the first page
    - research about the hunter's interest and previous hunts before pitching
- there's a strong competition on Monday and Tuesday and chances of going unnoticed are high
- accept feedbacks and comment back to each reply
- send a private invitation to beta features or offer something valuable to those who love your product
- you may be unexpectedly hunted by someone else and in that case, ask PH staff to delist you
- make Product Hunters feel special by adding a PH kitty banner on the homepage
- Tweet "thanks for the upvote!" to each supporter and follow them, offer discounts if possible
- add a blog post, press mentions, or interviews to the PH page
- attach a photo of yourself or team showing you're happy to be on the Product Hunt
- do not ask anyone directly to upvote you, always ask to support you
- after 6 months you can make some modifications to your product and repost
- make your intro comment honest, interesing, exciting, and explaining
- get a list of all who upvoted by using [this](https://product-hunt-upvotes.herokuapp.com/) tool and dev [token](https://www.producthunt.com/v1/oauth/applications)
- to gain followers, post new products of big companies and gain new followers
- challenge other members of the community by asking tough questions
- use emojis
- PH loves directories/lists of tools and resources
- must set up Google Analytics goals and Facebook pixel too
- prepare a list of possible questions that people may ask and write their answers too, it'll save time on the launch day
- do not just ask for money, build an awesome sales funnel
- show off your PH badges, it's a social proof
- publish your new updates and features as a new post on PH
- be careful when posting on the same domain (xyz.com/new-product), the algorithm may remove you for being a too frequent poster
- âš¡ if you want to publish an update/post a project on an already posted domain, wait atleast for 5-6 months
- create a live video stream of your PH launch on YouTube or FB, also prepare some contests
- launch another product on the next day to drive even more attention to your main product by mentioning the previous project in the first comment
- make new friends everyday, help others and share kindness

After all, Product Hunt is just the first step. You can still go forward even if you fail.

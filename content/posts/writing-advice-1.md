I was watching a video of Glenn Gers talking about how to writing effectively and he suggests to ask yourself the following 6 questions that make a great story:

- who is it about
- what do they want
- why they can't get it
- what they do about that
- why it doesn't work
- how does it end

Glenn says that a great story can't be written without asking yourself these 6 questions.

However, here's the full video:

While touchpads have some special gestures, it's still not faster than a mouse for writers.

If you're a writer, you must have tens of tabs and windows open on your computer and you must be frequently switching between those -- a computer mouse seems to work better and faster in that situation.

Touchpads are good only when you have less clickings to do.

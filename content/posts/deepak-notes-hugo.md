I love [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for its speed and quick build process.

Earlier, this site (Deepak's Notes) was powered by Jekyll and was hosted on Github Pages. But now, I have migrated it to Hugo and is hoted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://deepakness.com/blog/cloudflare-pages-vs-netlify/) now.

Since this is not my [main site](https://deepakness.com), it's not a problem even if the permalink structure has changed.

Anyways, looking forward to staying with Hugo at least for the next few months.

[Original Essay](https://perell.com/essay/expression-is-compression/)

- The process of gathering ideas and distilling them into a smaller, more compressed form is the essence of creative excellence.
- When we make “compression progress,” we become like Nike, which compressed its entire marketing philosophy into three words: “Just Do It.”
- The more information is compressed, the more efficiently it can travel from creator to consumer. Even if it’s an incomplete representation of reality, few things are more satisfying than concentrated gems of information that express a lot about the world.

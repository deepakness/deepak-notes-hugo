I ran a simple [poll on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/deepakness_you-can-also-mention-why-facebook-is-the-activity-6825597885040640000-kuLc/) asking which platforms helps you learn everyday, and the results are kind of surprising (at least, to me).

- LinkedIn - 69%
- Twitter - 13%
- Facebook - 8%
- Instagram - 11%

I was hoping to get Twitter as the answer but LinkedIn was a total surprise.

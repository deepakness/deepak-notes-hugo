### #1. Test first, double down later

> Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you're not innovating enough. **- Elon Musk**

Marketing channels are in abundance. Try and fail at them. And, double down on channels which offer you the best engagement.

### #2. Empathy

> My biggest mistake is weighing too much on someone's talent... it matters whether someone has a good heart. **- Elon Musk**

Talent fuels progress and accelerates scale. But without empathy, your brand will just be a brand with just a surface-level connection to it's audience.

### #3. Product first, marketing second

> Great companies are built on great products. **- Elon Musk**

First design the best product. Because marketing spent on a poor product is wasted marketing.

Good products are easier to market.

Refine, critique, repeat. And, then promote.

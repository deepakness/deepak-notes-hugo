title: "Telekinesis or Psychokinesis"
---

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinesis):

> Psychokinesis, or telekinesis, is an alleged psychic ability allowing a person to influence a physical system without physical interaction. Psychokinesis experiments have historically been criticized for lack of proper controls and repeatability.

- There is no proven evidence that psychokinesis is a real phenomenon, and the topic is generally regarded as pseudoscience.

> In parapsychology, fictional universes and New Age beliefs, psychokinesis and telekinesis are different: **psychokinesis** refers to the mental influence of physical systems and objects without the use of any physical energy, while **telekinesis** refers to the movement and/or levitation of physical objects by purely mental force without any physical intervention.

You might have seen the 'Carrie' movie prank a few years ago on YouTube. It was based on Telekinesis and went kind of viral.

Recently, I came across NFT domains (through [UnstoppableDomains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/)) and got fascinated with it. Everyone is talking about NFT arts but why only a few people are talking about acquiring crypto domains, I wonder.

I mean, Web 3.0 is coming and NFT domains are going to be a big thing much like the .com. People should start acquiring these kinds of domains from now. It could be a lot beneficial.

As of now, NFT domains are very cheap (except for some common words and company name domains) and can provide a decent return for selling.

And the best thing that I love the most about NFT domains are, you only have to pay once and it's forever yours unless you sell it. You can store it on your hardware wallet much like you store cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

What a fascinating concept!!!

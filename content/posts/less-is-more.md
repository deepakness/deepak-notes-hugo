People like compression!

In fact, David Perell, in the [expression is compression](https://perell.com/essay/expression-is-compression/) essay, says that:

> The process of gathering ideas and distilling them into a smaller, more compressed form is the essence of creative excellence.

Indeed! If you write, your readers time is limited, you got to make the blog post that you're writing as compressed as possible -- write, re-write and then re-write again, make it smaller and more compressed.

Another example is the computer files compression, we have limited bandwidth and storage and that's why it better and faster if the video, audio or image files are compressed as much as possible.

I am not saying that the "compression" doesn't alter the quality, it does. But you will have to optimize somewhere in between the file size and the quality. Much like `.mp3` files do, they are a compressed version of high quality audio and just for 10 MB filesize, normal users barely notice the audio quality drop -- that's what I am talking about.							

The same applies to everything -- your blog posts, videos, presentations, discussing ideas.

Try to say more with less words! But those words have to be properly written and practiced.

In design, this "less is more" approach is also called "minimal" or "minimilistic" design.

**Steal** from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination.

Devour films, music, books, paintings, poems, photographs, conversations, dreams, trees, architectures, street signs, clouds, light and shadows.

Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic.

Authenticity is invaluable.

**Originality is non-existent**.

Don't bother concealing your thievery - celebrate it.

> *It's not where you take things from, it's where you take them to.* - Jean-Luc Godard

Stolen from Jim Jarmusch

Hey all,

After the old [Windows 11 hub](https://notes.deepakness.com/posts/started-windows-11-hub/), I have now started a brand-new [Chromebook Hub](https://compile.blog/chromebook/) where you will find how-tos, tips-tricks, hacks, and tweaks related to Chromebooks.

Recently, I have started using [Asus Chromebook C423N](https://deepakness.com/blog/new-chromebook/) and it will be great to write or better to say, document everything as I progress. I have already set up my laptop in a way that it handles all my blogging tasks pretty well. Now, I will explain my experience of installing various apps in a better and efficient way.

See you in the hub.

Bye.

title: "Benefits of publishing short notes"
---

It's better to keep publishing all the short/mini notes in a separate section on your website than to wait for the full article to be completed.

Just write down your quick thoughts about anything and publish it right away.

And, you can use that piece of writing to post on the social media or use it inside your full blog posts.

Like I would not procrastinate to write a simple 2-3 line notes on any topic. These writings of mine are stored in a single place and I can refer to them anytime I want.

Easy, right?

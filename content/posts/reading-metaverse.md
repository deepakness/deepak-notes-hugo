So I have been reading a lot about Metaverse recently and the more I read, the more interesting it gets.

Some of the resources that I am following are:

- [The Metaverse Primer by Matthew Ball](https://www.matthewball.vc/the-metaverse-primer)
- [Medium Articles by Jon Radoff](https://jradoff.medium.com/)
- [#metaverse stories at Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/metaverse)

To begin and get an initial idea of what Metaverse is and how it'll changing the future of the world, the above resource are more than enough.

See ya after finishing all these. ðŸ‘‹

Instead of trying to rank your content for the keyword "weight loss", try to go long-tail first and try to rank for "weight loss for elderly people" -- this surprisingly increases the chances of ranking in the top #5 of Google.

You can find these long-tail keywords in the forums where your audience hangs out. Also, there are a lot tools too, for example, [Answer the Public](https://deepakness.com/blog/atp-blogging/) that I have been using for some of my blogs.

If you are confused about what's a long-tail keyword is, let me define that for you:

> Generally, a keyword consisting of 3 or more words is considered to be a long-tail keyword.

Simple, isn't it?

**And, if you ask what are advantages of targetting the long-tail keywords first?** A lot.

- easier to rank
- very low competition
- receives targeted audience
- converts a lot better

What else do you need!!!

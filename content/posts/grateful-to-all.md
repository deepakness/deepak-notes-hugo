Whom should you be grateful to? 🙋‍♂️

Answer: Everybody. 🐱‍🏍

Almost everybody you met has taught you something, even if you didn't like them. 🤷‍♂️

And, you should be grateful to:

👉 the person who told you can't do it - you started believing in yourself even more

👉 all the friends and classmates - they made that part of the life unforgettable

👉 the parents and teachers who scolded you - it made you disciplined

👉 the college senior who bullied you - it made you tough and sturdy

👉 the every other person that you ever met

There is a different perspective to look at the things; either in a positive way or negative, it's up to you.

Just #learn from things.

And, evolve. 🧬

PS: You should also be grateful to your ex (if any) - probably you met (or, will meet) a more compatible person due to her/him. 😁

One page landing pages are considered to be the best because they communicate the data, insights, and beliefs. They do not talk about the detailed specifications.

One pagers:

- Improve decision quality
- Improve outcomes
- Reduce risk
- Reduce rework and thrashing
- Reduce batch sizes
- Encourage cross-functional collaboration
- Discourage opacity
- Encourage novel solutions to valuable problems

### Sections to add in your One Pager

- Definition of awesome / celebration quotes
- Cost of Delay estimate
- Pivot and proceed points
- Key data points
- Key insights
- Actors (both internal and external)
- Dependencies and constraints
- Operating assumptions
- Open questions
- Assumptions to validate
- Risks to mitigate
- Baseline behavior (the status quo)
- Target condition/state
- Possible interventions
- Assumptions to validate

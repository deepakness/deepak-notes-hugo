I came to know about [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) a few months ago, watched a few videos back then and found it to be the simplest static site generator -- totally loved it.

But for the last few days I have been watching hours of tutotials related to it and decided to create my personal website using 11ty.

Today, tried doing that but I'm having issues related to CSS and decided to let it go for now. But... I will be back soon, for sure.

I absolutely love the idea that if you know HTML + CSS a bit then you can set up a fully functioning website easily.

To be honest, I like 11ty more than Hugo or Gatsby.

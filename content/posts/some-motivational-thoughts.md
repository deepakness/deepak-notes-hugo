Who are you?

What’s your significance?

Ask yourself, “who am I?” and you should get an answer back.

Before others assume you as lazy or good-for-nothing, define yourself. Because you will never fit in their definition.

They might call you “my lifeline” but that’s not your identity.

Brainstorm and discover within yourself.

Discover your potential.

Discover your passion.

Discover something you’re good at.

Don’t let others know you as a company’s employee.

Don’t be in the crowd.

Don’t participate in the rat race.

Be different.

Walk alone.

Life is short, utilize it in doing things that make you happy.

Lead your life in a direction where you see the future you.

Be independent, don’t always be surrounded by your friends and family.

Get out of your comfort zone.

Be hardcore.

Be badass.

Whatever you do, do it with full dedication.

Keep people around you happy and that’s what life is.

You’re awesome and the world needs you.

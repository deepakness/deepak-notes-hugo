I think, all the bloggers have a very different kind of setting on their computers for blogging. They have apps and tools set up in such a way that they can quickly access what they are looking for.

I also have one.

And, I wrote a detailed guide about how people can set up their [Windows 11 computers for blogging](https://compile.blog/windows/windows-11-for-blogging/) in such a way that it boosts their productivity. You should be able to note down an idea within seconds and you should be able to start writing within seconds. If you have to wait then it's not an ideal set up, most probably.

Mostly, I love free tools and the tools that are fast. Yes, I try them all but choose the one that's perfect for my usecase in every possible way.

While I do not like social media much, I think [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DeepakNesss/) is a great platform to learn what you're interested in. Mainly, I am interested in business, marketing, tech, and some programming stuff; I have followed some [interesting people](https://deepakness.com/blog/fav-creators/) on Twitter and I get a lot to learn from them, every single day.

In fact, now, I am thinking of being a bit more active on Twitter and actually, be serious about the platform a bit now. Also thinking of getting either FeedHive of Typefully to schedule interesting tweets. And, my tweets are mainly going to be about blogging and a bit about tech and other related stuff.

Also, I have decided to start a "tools of the week" tweet every Friday where I will be mentioning a tool that I really like -- it's gonna be awesome.

Let's see how my Twitter journey goes!

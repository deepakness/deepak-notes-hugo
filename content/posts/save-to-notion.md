title: "Save to Notion Chrome Extension is the best"
---

Notion has a nice [web clipper](https://www.notion.so/web-clipper) but that is only good for saving articles as a page/sub-page.

Recently, I came across a Chrome Extension called [Save to Notion](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-notion/ldmmifpegigmeammaeckplhnjbbpccmm?hl=en) and it's the best. üòç

You can directly save things to your Notion database and with much more customizations.

It's a must to have.

An interesting and insightful view on "why people buy" by Bikash.

Bikash explains:

> I recently bought a new alarm clock.

> I am a 27-year-old man. I live in Bengaluru, India. I love playing cricket. I love drinking coke and hear business podcast. I am active on a lot of social media channels, follow a lot of influencers. I love Odia food.

> So, these are all attributes about WHO I AM. And this could be very useful when targeting more people like me.

> But even if you come in front of me, WHAT YOU GONNA SAY TO ME?

> After all none of these explains, WHY DID I BUY AN ALARM CLOCK?

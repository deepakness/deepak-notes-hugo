Once up, blockchain domains are truly impossible to take down. However, they require a special setup to work as of now. They can't be opened in your normal browsers.

As of now, followings domain name extensions are available:

- `.crypto`
- `.x`
- `.888`
- `.wallet`
- `.nft`
- `.coin`
- `.bitcoin`, etc.

Anyways, here are the pros and cons of blockchain domains:

## Pros

- requires an one-time payment to buy -- no renewals needed
- once live, can't be taken down by the government

## Cons

- does not open in normal browsers

Maybe in the near future, there will be better supports for blockchain domains.

[Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/) is promoting these blockchain domains very much these days.

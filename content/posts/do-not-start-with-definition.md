Start your piece with a story, eye-opening fact, data or something interesting! Any piece of writing that starts with defining the subject is boring.

So, basically, the structure of your writing should be:

- Opening (something interesting)
- Definition
- More explanation
- Types/categories/features etc.
- Final words

And, always end it in a way that it makes readers think.

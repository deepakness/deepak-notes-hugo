It's said that when your conscious mind refuses to help, subconscious kicks and tries to pull you out of the situation.

We all have watched movies where the actor or hero does the unexpected and shocks everyone around, right? What do you think, would he have thought about taking that risk if he had used his conscious/logical mind? No, he wouldn't have taken the risk or at least, there was very very thin chances that he would have made the move. Clearly, subconscious kicked and tried to rescued him from the situation.

And no, I am not saying that the subconscious is always right, it can be wrong and get you in trouble but most of the time, it just tries to help you.

Oh! I almost forgot about the noise that I mentioned. I think, when I am in the public places like a coffee shop, travelling in a train etc., I tend to focus more than when I am at home, alone.

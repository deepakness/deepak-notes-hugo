Raw Notes from GrowthHackers article "LinkedIn Growth Engine: The Never Ending Viral Loop":

- In 2002, Reid Hoffman gathered a team of old SocialNet and PayPal colleagues.

- Hoffman and team were all set to build a new, lasting professional network based on indentity and connections.

- After 6 months, LinkedIn got launched on 5th May 2003.

    - After 1st week - 12.5k users
    - After 4 months - 50k users
    - After 1 year - 500k users
    - After 3 years, in 2006, they achieved profitability
    - After 8 years, in 2011, LinkedIn became a publicly traded company

**Stats after 11 years (2014)**

- $18 billion market cap
- 225 million users
- 200+ countries
- 4800 employees

**Stats as of 2021**

- 740 million users
- 200+ countries
- 15,800 employees
- 33 offices

## Initial Challenges

- Recent economic downturn (dot-com winter)

- Difficulties in defining the core concepts of the company - a social network or something else?

### How they overcame

- Hoffman invited Silicon Valley's successful friends and connections which quickly increased the appeal of LinkedIn.

- Eventually, it became a must-have app for up and coming Valley workers to get connected with potential investors and advisors.

- LinkedIn made easier for professionals to stay in touch even after changing jobs, phone numbers and email addresses.

- Initially, LinkedIn mainly focused around the Silicon Valley. They kickstarted their network effects by tapping into a local population where it could reach **critical mass**.

    - Facebook did the same after 5 years later - a single school.
    - Uber did the same after a decade later - a single city.

> This **critical mass** creates the utility needed in network businesses to create the high-quality must-have experience that breeds both user loyalty and word of mouth.

## Freemium

- LinkedIn kicked off their monetization efforts with Adbrite ads in mid-2004, but unsuccessful.

- They launched 3 lucrative revenue streams in 2005:

    - job listings
    - subscriptions
    - advertisements

- And, just after a year, they became profitable in 2006.

## Where they focused

> Itâ€™s Easier to Focus on a Strength than Improve a Weakness. - Elliot Shmukler

- 40% of signups were coming from LinkedIn Homepage (strength) and just 4% from email invitations (weakness).

    - On average, people who arrived organically visited 30 pages per session while people from invites visited just 10 pages per session.

- Another example of focusing on strengths: "Who's looked at your profile" emails had 20% CTR for active users and just 5% for inactive users.

    - They A/B tested subject lines, copy, and formatting of the emails only for active users which further increased the CTR.

## Growth first

- Active users play a critical role in bringing new users as well as re-activating inactive users.

- LinkedIn's virality was no coincidence.

- Initially, most of the users had only 1 connection - means, they accepted someone's invite but didn't connect with anyone else.

    - 25% new users actually typed email addresses to invite new users.
    - LinkedIn went ahead and created an Outlook plugin which let users easily upload their email contact list to LinkedIn to find new connections. It was very unique at that time.
        - 7% users uploaded their address books and invitations sent increased by 30%.

- LinkedIn asked all new users about their current company and title - 90% people answered this question.

    - After that they would be shown a list of people at their current company.

- When new users sent invitation to connect, current users received notifications to approve. And, once they came on the site, they were prompted to invite and connect with others.

    - This Reconnect Flow significantly increaed virality.

        - Pageviews increased 41%
        - Searches increased 33%
        - 38% more positions listed on profiles
        - Invitations increased 16%

> New users invite more new users and engage old users. And, then old users invite more new users. - That's **double viral loop**.

- LinkedIn introduced Endorsement feature which further re-engaged inactive users.

> This way, re-engaging inactive users is both less expensive than ads and more effective than reactivation emails.

## Search

- LinkedIn made profiles public which brought a lot of traffic from search engines.

- They waited until 2 million users before user profile indexing.

    - When people clicked on someone's profile from search engine, they had to sign up to connect with the person.

## Acquisitions

- LinkedIn acquired Gmail plugin Rapportive for $15M which lets users connect with their contacts on LinkedIn [Feb 2012].

- Because presentations are important for professionals, LinkedIn acquired SlideShare for $119M [May 2012].

## Content

- In 2011, they launched **LinkedIn Today** which culled articles that a user's coworkers and industry peers are sharing.

- Users could also share and comment on those articles.

- In 2012, LinkedIn launched an **Influencer program** which allowed selected thought leaders to create original exclusive contents and users could just follow without getting connected to them.

- The influencer program is not just good for LinkedIn but for the influencers too.

    - 22% influencer followers are entry level professionals
    - 49% are director-level or above

## Mobile

- 41% of LinkedIn traffic comes from mobile devices.

- In 2013, they launched a new app called LinkedIn Intro which allowed users to LinkedIn profiles right into the iPhone Mail App.

    - Means, if someone receives an email from unknown sender, they will also be able to see their LinkedIn profile.

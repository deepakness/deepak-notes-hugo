Utopian and dystopian fiction are genres of speculative fiction that explore social and political structures.

- **Utopian fiction** portrays a setting that agrees with the author's ethos, having various attributes of another reality intended to appeal to readers.
- **Dystopian fiction** offers the opposite: the portrayal of a setting that completely disagrees with the author's ethos.

Some novels combine both genres, often as a metaphor for the different directions humanity can take depending on its choices, ending up with one of two possible futures.

Both utopias and dystopias are commonly found in science fiction and other types of speculative fiction.

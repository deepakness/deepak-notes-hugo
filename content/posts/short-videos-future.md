I have seen YouTubers defending the platform by saying the Tiktok-styled videos are trash and provide no or negligible value to the readers. I say, whatever... No matter how much YouTubers state the platform as good -- Tiktok-like videos are the future.

Why?

Because the attention span of people is decreasing, they prefer shorter and different things in the same time. I mean, they would prefer to watch 10 short standup comedy videos over an 1-hour video of a single comedian and it's pretty justified.

Let me explain that with some examples:

A few decades earlier, the movies used to be more than 3 hours long and people actually sat down to watch the movies, today? Nobody will watch a that long movie. Today movies are mostly 1.5 hours or max. to max. 2 hours long.

Another example would be the Cricket game. Earlier, there was a test Cricket format that lasted 5-days straight and people would stick to their TVs to watch the whole game. Then they introduced a shorter version called one-day Cricket that lasted almost a day and a even newer version is the T-20 Cricket that only lasts a couple of hours. I am sure they will soon introduce a even shorter version of the game.

The same thing is with these short Tiktok-styled videos. People love them because they are short and the next videos come as a surprise to the viewers. They don't know what's coming next and also, moving on to the next video requires lesser effort than that of the YouTube, just a flick of the finger.

Clearly, why wouldn't it be popular?

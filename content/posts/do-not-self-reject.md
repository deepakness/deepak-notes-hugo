No matter what, do not self-reject yourself.

Even if you think that you're not fit for the job, apply for it anyway.

Even if you think that they're not going to reply, send the email anyway.

Even if you think that no one would read what you write, publish it anyway.

It might be worth trying.

Do not self-reject.

description: Do not be shy! Let people read your stuff and let them tell you that it's a garbage.

I remember when I first started to write, I was very conscious about how people will react to it but I forgot the fact that nobody was going to read that initially.

I had questions like:

- what if my writing style is not good enough and someone makes fun of that
- what if there are some grammar and spelling mistake in the writing
- what if it's a very simple topic to write about and everyone already knows about it, etc.

And, guess what when I hit publish for the first few times, every thing that I was worrying about was gone. There was no fear of being judged or anything. Yes, you may get some mean comments, take it as a constructive criticism and move on.

My only advice for the new and aspiring writers and bloggers is -- publish whatever you like and let it expose to critism, post the link to your social media, send it to some of your friends and listen to whatever they have to say. This is how it works.

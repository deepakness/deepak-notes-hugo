Rob Fitzpatrick explains in [this Indie Hackers post](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/your-obsession-with-winning-at-hacker-news-and-product-hunt-is-hurting-your-business-c05505b902) that you should get customers organically first, make a small group of people believe in your product and then go nuts about the marketing at a large scale.

Rob advertised his business on the America's largest talkshows, traffic spike was huge but only for a few days. People liked his product but did not love it.

> He suggests: Go nuts with the publicity stunts only if your retention and organic growth are strong.

Some lessons:

- do not go to Product Hunt or Hacker News until you have a few organic users who love your product
- focus on retention and referral
- doing the PR release early can hurt your business

That's it.

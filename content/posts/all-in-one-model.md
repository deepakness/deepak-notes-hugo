When entering into a market where the competition is already high, you have quite a few options to play your cards -- either you can lower the prices or offer better features at the same price as your competitors. And, then only you will be recognized by the people, right?

Another similar marketing/business model is the "all-in-one" model where businesses offer features of multiple similar products bundled as one. I bet you have seen this earlier. The best and the most popular example would be the [Notion app](https://compile.blog/tools/notion-so/), which replaces famous tools like Jira, Asana, Google Docs, Trello, Todoist, etc. Yes, almost all the great features of these tools are there in Notion.

So, is this "all-in-one" model an effective strategy to beat your competitors?

The answer is yes, it's doable. The way Notion carried out itself is amazing.

You too can do it... if you can avoid burning all your resources chasing those established competitors this way. Otherwise, other competition-fighting-strategies are always there to look out to.

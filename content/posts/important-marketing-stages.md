1. **Discovery**

    - people discover your products/services

1. **Assessing**

    - people follow people
    - people compare your product with others
    - your business must have a social proof
    - become an expert because people also follow experts

2. **Admitting**

    - when a prospect decides to buy
    - make buying processes easy
    - checkout process should be seamless

3. **Buyer's Remorse Phase**

    - it's sense of regret after having made a purchase
    - after buying, customer's excitement starts to reduce
    - one way to deal with buyer's remorse is bonuses/rewards/surprises
    - our goal should be to keep them away from buyer's remorse

4. **Activating**
    
    - delivering the promises made to the customer
    - build trust, it's a big part of marketing

5. **Acclimating**

    - building a next level relationship with the customer
    - keeping current customers is harder than gaining new customers
    - retaining current customers increases profits
    - introduce new customers to your company in an organized and effective manner

6. **Adopting**

    - when the customer takes ownership of the relationship
    - if customers adapt, they see themselves as fans (not customers)
    - product adopting is more important than marketing
    - product adoption is the "experience around it" and "relationships people build with it"

7. **Advocating**

    - earned media is the best kind of media
    - imagine people publishing good stories without you ever asking them
    - imagine people buying your product as gift to others
    - imagine people recommending your product to their friends without any rewards in returns

That's it.

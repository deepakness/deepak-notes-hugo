I wish there was an app where I could follow all the social accounts of a person in a single place.

e.g. If I want to follow Bill Gates, then whether it's his Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, or LinkedIn; I should be able to follow all the updates in a single app.

Wouldn't that be amazing?

Not sure how it'll be done; but it's pretty much doable, I think.

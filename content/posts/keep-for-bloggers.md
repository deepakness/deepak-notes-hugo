As a writer/blogger, you need a tool that offers a faster and easier way to add quick notes so that you don't miss anything important that comes to your mind while you were out for a walk, cooking or chilling in the garden.

I believe [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) is one of such tools that stays on my phone, I can quickly open it and take notes in whatever format that I am comfortable with at the time. Notes format that Google Keep supports are:

- Text
- Pictures
- Voice/audio
- Checklists
- Drawing

Let's say, you're walking down the road listening to your favorite podcast and suddenly [you get an idea](https://twitter.com/DeepakNesss/status/1453350418474577921?s=20) about starting some new features for your website. You will have to stop walking for a while to take text notes, but at the time you can quickly take a voice note and narrate everything that's on your mind, without stopping.

And, the best thing is all your notes are also accessing from the browser if you visit to [https://keep.google.com/](https://keep.google.com). Means, the notes that you take on a single device (smartphone or desktop), will be immediately available to all your devices, connected to the same Google account.

How cool is that!

For [writing](https://deepakness.com/blog/how-i-started-writing/), I use regularly use Google Tool with some [other amazing tools](https://deepakness.com/blog/tools/).

Happy blogging!

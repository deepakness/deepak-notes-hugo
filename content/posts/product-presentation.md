- **Tell your customer’s story**

People remember stories.

Use the classic story model:

- The hero → The user
- The villain → Their problem
- Setup → Conflict → Resolution

> Your story? Helping the hero slay the villain.

- **Keep it short and concise**

Leave out unneeded details.

Know your audience and their goals.

Answer domain specific questions at the end.

**Tip:** Add an FAQ part at the end.

- **Use visuals**

People prefer pictures.

Pictures convey more than text.

Assume no one wants to read.

- **Use analogies**

Analogies break down hard concepts.
Use them often.

- **(Bonus) Address F.U.D. early**

Point out any fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

Address them in the presentation.

You’ll win the audience over.

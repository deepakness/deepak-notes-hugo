WhatsApp has launched the most awaited feature - [multi-device](https://twitter.com/DeepakNesss/status/1422810002058670085) (beta). Now, you can connect upto 4 devices to your WhatsApp account without even keeping your smartphone online.

I checked by turning off internet on my smartphone and then opened the WhatsApp Web on my laptop, it worked perfectly as expected.

Not to mention, messages will still be end-to-end encrypted.

[Consumer capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_capitalism) is a theoretical economic and social political condition in which consumer demand is manipulated in a deliberate and coordinated way on a very large scale through mass-marketing techniques, to the advantage of sellers.

It suggests manipulation of consumer demand so potent that it has a coercive effect, amounts to a departure from free-market capitalism, and has an adverse effect on society in general.

According to one source, the power of such 'manipulation' is not straightforward. It depends upon a new kind of individualism - **projective individualism**, where persons use consumer capitalism to project the kind of person who they want to be.

Some use the phrase as shorthand for the broader idea that the interests of other non-business entities (governments, religions, the military, educational institutions) are intertwined with corporate business interests, and that those entities also participate in the management of social expectations through mass media.

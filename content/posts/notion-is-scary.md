By not introducing the offline mode, Notion is becoming scary.

On 4th Jan, it was down for hours and I couldn't do a thing during that time.

The amount of personal and work related data that I've saved scares me even more.

Notion should immediately introduce offline mode.

Till then keeping a regular local backup is very necessary.

title: "Where do your emails land?"
---

Recently, I discovered a tool which lets you know exactly where do your emails land - inbox, spam/junk or promotions.

And, it's free.

It's called [GMass - Inbox, Spam, or Promotions?](https://www.gmass.co/inbox) and it works perfectly.

Just send the email to the provided email addresses and the tool will let you know where they landed, instantly.

It's kinda awesome.

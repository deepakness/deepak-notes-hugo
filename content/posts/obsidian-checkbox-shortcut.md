I have been manually writing `- [ ]` inside Obsidian to create checkboxes. It's not very difficult but not the most efficient way to **create checkboxes in Obsidian**.

But here's a simple shortcut to do that:

**If you're on Windows/Linux**:

- `ctrl + enter` - it creates a list
- `ctrl + enter` again - it cretes a checkbox

**If you're on Mac**:

- `cmd + enter` - creates a list
- `cmd + enter` again - creates a checkbox

Means, press `ctrl/cmd + enter` 2 times and the checkbox will be created.

Thats's it.

Hope that helps.

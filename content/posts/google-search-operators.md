Sometimes, finding what you really need on Google is difficult. It shows the search results that are the most relevant but still may not fulfil your requirements.

But... Google Search Operators are the answer. If you can do it right, you can find almost anything that has been indexed by Google.

## Interesting Google Search Operators

Please note that most of the time, it doesn't matter if you're putting these Google search operators at the beginning or end of a search query.

### 1. cache

Find the recent cache of a webpage, for example:

```
cache:deepakness.com
```

Helpful if a webpage recently changed and you want to see its previous version.

### 2. " "

Putting your search terms in quotes helps you perform an exact-match search on Google, for example:

```
"digital human"
```
 
Or,
 
```
"export standard notes"
```
 
### 3. OR
 
Shows the search results related to either of the words, for example:
 
```
metaverse OR multiverse
```
 
You can also use this operator multiple times, for example:
 
```
metaverse OR multiverse OR universe
```
 
### 4. AND
 
Just the opposite of OR, it shows the results that match all the mentioned words (not just some or one of them):

```
zuckerberg AND facebook AND metaverse
```
 
### 5. site
 
Limits the search to a specific website
 
For example, if you have to search for tweets mentioning web3:
 
```
site:twitter.com web3
```
 
Now, you will get search results containing the word "web3" but only from Twitter.
 
### 6. filetype
 
Shows search results containing a certain filetype only, for example:
 
```
rain water harvesting filetype:PDF
```
 
### 7. related
 
Helps you find sites that are related to the given site, for example:
 
```
related:amazon.com
```
 
You will find some interesting results here.
 
### 8. inurl
 
Finds results that contain the specific word in their URL, for example:

```
wordpress tutorial inurl:wp
```

This returns pages that are about WordPress Tutorials but have the word "wp" in the URL.
 
### 9. .. (dot dot)
 
Helps you search for a range of numbers, for example:
 
```
google io 2015..2020
```
 
### 10. *
 
Acts as a wildcard and matches any word or phrase in place of it, for example:
 
```
elon musk * tesla
```
 
## Other advanced uses

You can also combine these search operator to conduct an even more advanced search on Google and increase the chances of finding exactly what you're looking for.

Here're some examples:

- If you have to search for software engineers who talk post about "blockchain" or "ethereum" on the social media like Twitter and LinkedIn, here's how to do it:

```
"blockchain" AND (site:twitter.com OR site:linkedin.com)
```

- If you have to search about all the research papers, ebooks, and white papers related to NFT in PDF format, here's how to do it:

```
"NFT" AND ("whitepaper" OR "white paper" OR "research paper" OR "research" OR "ebook") AND filetype:PDF
```

You get the idea, right?

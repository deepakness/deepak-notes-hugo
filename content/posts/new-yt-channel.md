I am thinking of starting a new YouTube channel named "DeepakNess". Initially, there will be random tech video that I need to embed on my blog and later, when I am a bit more stable and when I get a new laptop, I will organize regular YouTube live videos related to writing, blogging, and coding.

I might not be regular at first, but I will have to evolve, eventually.

Let's see how it goes.

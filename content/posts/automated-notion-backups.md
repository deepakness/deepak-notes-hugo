title: "Automated Notion backups"

Yesterday, Notion was down for hours and it got me searching for available automated backup options.

After researching a bit, I found a way and wrote an [article](https://compile.blog/2021/01/06/automatic-notion-backup/) about it.

It explains how to setup automatic regular backup of your entire Notion account with GitLab.

After experimenting a bit, I was able to successfully set up the automation.

And, it's working perfectly. üòç
